# Word-Guess-Game
This is a simple, Western-Stylized version of the classic hangman game. 

The user only has to begin typing the alphabetical keys on the keyboard in order to start playing.
All the words in the game revolve around a Western theme.

# Operation
1. A word is randomly selected from a list of possible words you can spell.
2. Upon typing a key, if the player guessed a letter that is present in the word, the letter(s) will display on the screen and replace the blanks from the word.
3. If the player guessed a wrong key, it is added to the "missed guesses" section of the UI and you lose one of your remaining (false) guesses.
4. The player has 5 missed guesses before they lose the round.
5. If you successfully complete the word, your "wins" go up by one; if you lose, your "losses" go up by one.
6. After either winning or losing a round, a new word is automatically (randomly) selected and a new round will begin unless all words have already been found from the list available.
